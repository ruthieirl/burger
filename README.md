## What is it?

A full stack application with the front end implemented with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and the back end with Node.js and Express.  Data is stored in a MySQL database.  HTML templating is done handled with the use of Handlebars.


## How To Use

The user is the host to a dinner party. The Eat-Da-Burger Dinner Party. The user will be prompted to invite burgers to the party. Once the burger is invited, it populates the guest list/menu with a button. When the user clicks the button, the adjacent burger is "eaten" and no longer shows on the menu, but in a list of all the "eaten" burgers.
